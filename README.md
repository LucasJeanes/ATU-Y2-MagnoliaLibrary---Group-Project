# MagnoliaLibrary-OOP-Project
The group project is a Java-based library application that utilizes a MySQL database to store information. 
The application allows users to rent books, music, computers, and to buy stationary at a discounted price if the user has an account.
The MySQL database is used to store information about the library's collection, such as books, music, and computers, 
as well as information about the users, such as name, address and phone number. The application uses JDBC to communicate with the database and execute SQL queries.
Users can create an account, which allows them to rent and purchase stationary items at a discounted price up to 20%. Users can also search for items in the library's
collection and check their availability. The application tracks items that are currently rented out and out of stock.
Overall, the Java-based library application offers users a simple and quick method to interact with the library's collection and to rent items and to buy stationary.
